[1] " great dog food!  my golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs i've ever met.  after experimenting with various types of food, i have found she loves natural balance.  what i really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  furthermore, i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so i figured why not.  i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />additionally, i started purchasing off amazon because petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save $20 each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazon.<br /><br />all in all, i definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  while i have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it."

[1] " best of the instant oatmeals  mccann's instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. there is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  still, the mccann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. it's even better than the organic, all-natural brands i have tried.  all the varieties in the mccann's variety pack taste good.  it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />mccann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. one thing i do not like, though, is mccann's use of thickeners.  oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. but this is a convenience product.  maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant mccann's becomes too thick and gluey."

[1] " forget molecular gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!  i know the product title says molecular gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  i have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  i use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, i hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  i really don't think they are good for the body.  on the other hand, i hate using cold milk or cream, because i like hot coffee.<br /><br />i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  i also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. the non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  you will have to play with the ratios - i would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. also, i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. i like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />for flavoring, i bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  if you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars. i also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online.  take the time to experiment.  maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. or don't add any flavorings.  it is up to you.  also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."

[1] " great dog food  my 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. he's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. on the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the natural balance dog food a day. when you take this into account, you're actually getting more \"bang for your buck\" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with amazon prime... i'm sold!!"

[1] " warning!  warning!  -alcohol sugars!  buyer beware please! this sweetener is not for everybody.  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  i thought i'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before.  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  as the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate. my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! thank goodness i'd eaten only a little. i still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. in case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

[1] " forget molecular gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!  i know the product title says molecular gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  i have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  i use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, i hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  i really don't think they are good for the body.  on the other hand, i hate using cold milk or cream, because i like hot coffee.<br /><br />i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  i also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. the non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  you will have to play with the ratios - i would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. also, i think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. i like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />for flavoring, i bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  if you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars. i also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online.  take the time to experiment.  maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. or don't add any flavorings.  it is up to you.  also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great."

[1] " best of the instant oatmeals  mccann's instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. there is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  still, the mccann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. it's even better than the organic, all-natural brands i have tried.  all the varieties in the mccann's variety pack taste good.  it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />mccann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. one thing i do not like, though, is mccann's use of thickeners.  oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. but this is a convenience product.  maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant mccann's becomes too thick and gluey."

[1] " warning!  warning!  -alcohol sugars!  buyer beware please! this sweetener is not for everybody.  maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  i thought i'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before.  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  as the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate. my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! thank goodness i'd eaten only a little. i still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. in case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

[1] " oatmeal for oatmeal lovers  mccann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. it's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccann's and other well-known oatmeals. what i personally like about mccann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america. the apples & cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  the only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. this is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal."
