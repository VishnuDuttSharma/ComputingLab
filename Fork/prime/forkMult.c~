/* 
Author: Vishnu Dutt Sharma
Roll No.: 12EC35018
Objective: 
	This module takes two inputs from user: 
		(1) Number which has two prime factors
		(2) Number of processes
Objective:
	It prints the prime factor of the input (assuming the input has only two prime factors)
	It also prints the time taken in calculation
	Whole processe is done by searching in the range (1,sqrt(number)) by dividing this operation
	in 'm' processes

/* primeFactorTwo(long int, long int, long int)
Input: 
	num: Number whose prime factors are to be determined
	start: Integer starting from which the search is to be performed
	stop: Integer at which search is to be stopped 
Output:
	i: Number which is a prime factor in the range (start, stop)
Objective:
	The function finds the smallest prime factor in range (start, stop)
	If no prime factor is found then '0' is returned
	If a prime factor is found,then '1' is printed
